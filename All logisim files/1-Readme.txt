when you open file OPEN THIS.circ 
whenever you will be asked for 

comparator(3 bit) -> add comparator.circ (in libraries for raminder folder)
or
comparator-> add comparator.circ (in libraries for raminder folder)
 (they are the same exact file)

any other requirment you will find it by its name correct

note:that program might ask for the same thing its not an error 
it opens at the end.


we are sorry we knew its very annoying we tried to solve it but we failed.
thank you!
we are sorry again for that irritation.
